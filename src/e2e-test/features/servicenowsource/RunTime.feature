Feature: ServiceNow Source - Run time scenarios

  @TS-SN-RNTM-1 @SN_SOURCE_CONFIG @SN_RECEIVING_SLIP_LINE @BQ_SINK @Required
  Scenario: Verify user should be able to preview the pipeline where ServiceNow source is configured for Table mode
    When Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    And Select plugin: "ServiceNow" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "ServiceNow"
    And configure ServiceNow source plugin for table: "RECEIVING_SLIP_LINE" in the Table mode
    And fill Credentials section for pipeline user
    And Enter input plugin property: "startDate" with value: "start.date"
    And Enter input plugin property: "endDate" with value: "end.date"
    Then Validate "ServiceNow" plugin properties
    And Capture the generated Output Schema
    And Close the Plugin Properties page
    And Select Sink plugin: "BigQueryTable" from the plugins list
    And Connect source as "ServiceNow" and sink as "BigQuery" to establish connection
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "BigQuery"
    And Replace input plugin property: "project" with value: "projectId"
    And Enter input plugin property: "datasetProject" with value: "datasetprojectId"
    And Configure BigQuery sink plugin for Dataset and Table
    Then Validate "BigQuery" plugin properties
    And Close the Plugin Properties page
    And Preview and run the pipeline
    Then Verify the preview of pipeline is "success"
